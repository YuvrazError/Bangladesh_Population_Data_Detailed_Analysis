# Bangladesh_Population_Data_Detailed_Analysis
Analyzed Bangladeshi population data by loading and cleaning the dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and performing feature engineering. Trained and evaluated Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict 2022 population. Compared predictions with actual data for Dhaka and measured model accuracy.

# Description of Tasks in the Notebook
## Loading the Dataset:
- The dataset containing population data for various cities and regions in Bangladesh is loaded from a CSV file.
- The first few rows of the dataset and a summary of its contents are displayed to understand its structure and data types.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Any necessary data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values or correcting data types, are performed.
- The dataset is prepared for analysis, ensuring all columns are in the correct format and contain relevant information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Various visualizations and statistical analyses are conducted to explore the data.
- Key insights about population trends, growth rates, and distribution are derived from the visualizations.

## Feature Engineering:
- Relevant features are selected and engineered to be used in machine learning models.
- This step involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

# Machine Learning Models:

## Linear Regression:
- A Linear Regression model is trained using the population data from 1991, 2001, and 2011 to predict the population in 2022.
- The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.

## Random Forest Regressor:
- A Random Forest Regressor model is also trained using the same features.
- The performance of this model is similarly evaluated using MSE and R2 metrics.

## Predictions for Dhaka:
- The population data for Dhaka from 1991, 2001, and 2011 is used to make predictions for the population in 2022 using both models.
- The predicted values are compared to the actual population value for 2022.
- Accuracy metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), are calculated to measure the accuracy of the predictions.

## Comparative Analysis:
- A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
- The actual population value for Dhaka in 2022 is compared with the predicted values from both models.
- The accuracy of each model is discussed based on the calculated error metrics.
- These steps provide a comprehensive analysis of the population data, leveraging machine learning models to make predictions and evaluate their performance.
